    <h1>Professional Work</h1>
    <p>
      Beginning my computer science degree at Virginia Tech, I aspire to mix some of my interests in visual design into my work or work towards finding a career that suits my interests. Throughout my time at Virginia Tech, I hope to gain a bachelors of science in computer science and masters of engineering. This can hopefully allow me to fully explore different areas of focus within the field of computer science. Each year I find myself talking to more and more people about my academic pursuits and what I am interested in, and I always come out of the conversation with a new viewpoint and a desire to learn more about what I do not know within my field. Prior to a conversation I had with an accelerated masters student, I was set on pursuing human computer interaction as focus for my masters, but after a long conversation, I realized that pursuing a focus in software development and applications contains a lot more related content that I find more appealing.

      I think I have become more and more passionate about my career because of how helpful it is to people and how it is so important to know about because of the advances in technology. I hope to find a field where I can learn it all. By this I do not mean to know all the coding languages, but to understand the company's processes and to really be involved in a company not just in one location but to understand where everything falls and why. My recent internship experience as a web design intern allowed me to explore my interest in visualization and user interfaces with less coding. This let me focus on the visualization part that I found interesting in computer science and to see where I fall with my passions being user interface, user experience, human computer interaction, and knowing full stack development. I believe that the strong communication skills, determination, and openness to learn new things will make me a competent individual to pursue the field of computer science.
